# Info
The DAO (Data Access Objects) layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It provides methods to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database entities and separates the database logic from the rest of the application logic.

# Examples:
- Repositories, that manage data operations for specific models.
- Data Access Methods to interact with the database using JPA (Java Persistence API) or JDBC.
